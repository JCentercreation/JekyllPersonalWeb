Hey guys,

This week I have discovered a silly "method" to stick to your purposes and start doing what you want to do. Maybe you all already know it but for me this method blew my mind when I stumble with it and realised how solid it is. When it comes to start a new activity or project, above all if those are challenging for me, I have the feeling that *"maybe I am not good enough yet for doing that so until I am good enough I will not go for it"*. I guess this feeling comes from my perfectionist way of living (which I am also trying too get rid of).

Well the first thing that I realised about is that ***you don't need to be good to start but you need to start in order to be good***. I know that it sounds so simple but I just forgot about it. When we were child and we started cycling we obviously did not know how to ride a bike and that thought did not push us out of the way. So now when it comes to starting a personal blog, or coding your own apps or making your own website, or setting up a YouTube channel or ...why the feeling of *"wait a moment I don't know how to write, I don't know how to code and I don't know how to edit a video...so I will not do it until I'm good at it"*?*...*how the hell I will be good at anything if I don't start doing it?

Now maybe you are thinking *"congratulations man, you have discovered that there is no point in thinking too much about something and not putting it into practice...but the hot question is: how to start doing what you don't know how to do?"*. Well I just try to apply myself this three steps:

- **Make it EXIST**: at the very beginning of starting doing or building something don't try to make it perfect from scratch. I personally guess it is mandatory to assess and think before taking action, but start doing and when you realise whatever you are doing is still not good, keep going on and just make it exists for you. The worst action is better than the best thought. (Little disclaimer: last sentence is only legit if the results of your actions are not gonna affect anyone else but you. Do not release your product or whatever it could be to other people until it os functional at least).
- **Make it FUNCTIONAL**: once it exists (whatever it is) is time to make it functional and focus on the outcome. Making it functional means that what you are creating solves a need. Maybe your first website is not pretty and it looks like the first nerdy webpages of the early 90's, but it has a banner to navigate through, a contact link with your data to let anyone reach out, and even a picture! So now it is functional, it works.
- **Make it EFFECTIVE**: now that it is functional its time to think about making it as good as posible, to decorate, to get rid of the the inefficiencies and the like. Now it is really the time to care about perfection.

Just wanted to share with you this ideas I came across with last week. Hopefully it could be useful for someone else than me.

Have a great week!!

# Things I've enjoyed this week 🎉

- **Webscraping with Python:** its been a while since the last time (at least a couple of month) I wrote a script to automate any of my daily tasks. So this week I decided to go back to my past coding routines (when I say "coding" I mean back-end stuff...sorry front-end developers 😜) in order to get rid of some silly activities that drain my time.
- Book: ***The Rosie Effect*** by Graeme Simsion. This is the second part of ***The Rosie Project,*** which recommended last week. Again a lovely story about a professor with autism that has a to deal with life problems.
