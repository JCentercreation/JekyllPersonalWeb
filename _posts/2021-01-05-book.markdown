<p style="text-align: justify">This book was written by Donald Miller, an american writer and marketing expert who helps companies, business owners and people in general to build a proper marketing strategy which allows them to be much more successfully with their businesses and life.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Since Marketing was labeled as a proper business development realm in the early years of the twenty century many gurus and showmen have tried to find like the philosopher's stone that gives the power to any company to sell any product or service, never mind if it solves any customer issue or not, to any client, never mind if he has financial issues or not, at any price, never mind if it is a good value for money or not. Maybe you are thinking that finally they did, spilled the secret to Steve Jobs and Apple was founded then...but the didn't. In this book you can discover what should be the real goal of marketing applied to your company, which are the core motivations which drives human beings to get a product or service and to pay for it and you will learn also a methodology to apply that principles to your real business.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Many companies uses marketing to accomplish one unique goal: sell more. And I'm not gonna be naive or cynic and say that shouldn't be the purpose of any company because companies are built to offer a value to the society and get money (at the end money is a value exchanging vehicle) for that. But if companies approaches to marketing in just that way, to make a quick buck, they are making a great mistake. As I previously said, companies are out there to offer a value to the customers, but what is a value? Well since the first days of humankind until nowadays human beings we have been pursuing the same primary goals: food (getting alive), home (security) and a partner to rise childs (survival of the animal specie). Any product or service who is been sold solves at least one of this three needs. And if you are wondering about, for instance, what is about the last iPhone? Why people is buying a 1000$ product that solves a communication need that could be also be satisfied with a half price device?Does it give us food, a home or a partner? And the answer is absolutely yes. For many people having the last iPhone is a way of social respect, that social respect can offers security because it is more likely that more people want to be your friend because we associate having money to being successful and everyones want to be a friend of a successful person and so if someday you are in trouble with something or someone then the more friends you have the more likely you will overcome that issue, and also social respect is also valuable to find a partner. I think you get the point about this. So at the end of the day, the final target of marketing for any company should not be selling a product but enhancing customers lifes according to that three major needs as a backgorund, and sometimes to achieve that goal it is suitable to recommend buying a product or not to do that because what a company should desire is not only selling today a product, but also sell a product tomorrow...and to accomplish that, the customers needs to trust the company in the long term and not only today.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Ok, now we know what the customers need, but how can the company show up as the one who is going to solve that needs? Well this is the key question that Donald Miller answer in this book and it is also one of the first mistakes that many companies make when approaching to their clients, and it is to try to be the hero. People we do not want an hero inside our lifes, we want to be the hero of our lifes!!! So the companies that show up as the hero, the ones who introduces itself as the problem solver or the like are the ones that are reject. Otherwise the companies who try to be the guide instead of the hero are the successful ones in the long term. Don't get me wrong, as Donald Miller said: the company should show clearly what sort of problems can solve for the customers and not only that, but also have to show the drawbacks of not getting the product or hiring the services and the benefits of getting it, but as I said, by putting the client in the spotlight. "Together we can achieve a better life" is better and completely different to "without me you will not achieve a better life". Think about movies: the main character always needs a guide, always. The main character, the hero, is not an hero at all at the beginning, usually is a mess but he enhances his life hitting a goal and finally becomes an hero overcoming a bunch of issues and difficulties thanks to the guide advices. And those are the sort of movies and characters usually viewers hook on, in the same way we want our clients to be hooked on our company or brand. So it seems logical for a company to be the guide, to show what and where the client is now and where he could be by overcoming a difficulty following the guide advices.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I don't want to spoil any other think about the book because I think you will delight reading it and discovering all the things by yourself, but I guess everyone now knows that building a good marketing campaign for your company is pretty similar to creating a great movie story.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">At the beginning I said that this book can help both companies an regular people to create a proper story brand, and that the advices you can get from this book could also be applied to our personal lifes. An so it is, but this last topic is addressed in another Donald Miller's book so stay tune if you want to boost your life and create a great story for it, because remember: no-one wants to watch a movie about a person who, at the end, buys a car.</p>

Thanks for reading.
