<p style="text-align: justify">Hans Rosling was a swedish doctor and lecturer at Karolisnka Institutet (School of medicine). He gave numerous talks around the world (you should watch a few of them at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKbO6O3O3M">Youtube</a> üçø. He swallows a sword at the end of the talk, not kidding) to many sort of people, from regular ones who attended to a TED Talk to world leaders gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He also cofounded the Gapminder Foundation, heading one goal: bring light to the truth by assessing objetive data.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">If I ask you this questions:</p>
<br>
<header style="background-color: #F7F7F7; border-radius: 20px; padding: 10px">
<p style="text-align: center"> At poor countries, how many young girls finish primary education?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> a) 20%       b) 40%      c) 60%</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center">In the las 100 years, the number of deaths by natural desasters has...</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> a) more than doubled       b) remained roughtly the same      c) decreased to less than half</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center">Nowadays, around the world, how many childs less than 1 year all recieved at least one vaccine?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> a) 20%      b) 50%      c) 80%</p>
</header>
<p style="text-align: justify">I have to admit that the first time I made this test I didn't get any right answer to any of this questions. If you chose the c) for all of them, you are right: the world is not going from bad to worst as we usually tend to think. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">It is surprisingly amazing how humand beings tend to figure out an image of everything around us by a bias thinking</p>

Thanks for reading.
