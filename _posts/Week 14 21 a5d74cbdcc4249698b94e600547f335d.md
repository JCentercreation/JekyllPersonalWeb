# Starting where it all began

Hey guys,

It has already started. I'm following an specific training plan for a new half marathon race in June. As you may know running is one of my favourite hobbies: it clears my mind and keep the stress at bay. This will not be the first half-marathon I run but it will be the first one I train for consciously. It's been a while since the last time I run an official race (I mean going to a popular race event. I'm not a pro) and last year my physical endurance dropped up to not acceptable levels, if I compare it with my glorious days (that time when I was at college and girls used to chase me because of my magnificent hair) when I was able to run an HM around 1h 40 min. Indeed now I am sure that I would not be able to do it under 2h. So that's the target.

I'm following an specific training plan for completing an HF in less than 2 hours. It's about an average of four sessions weekly plan, both short and long runs. But those mid-long distances races are not only about good cardiovascular condition. Not only is required that heart and lungs are going to successfully manage the effort, but also your muscles and joints need to do that, so I'm combining the runs with strength exercises that I also mix with plyometric ones. You can have a look to the full schedule [here](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/half-marathon/a776305/how-to-run-a-sub-2-hour-half-marathon/).

I strongly believe that you can't improve what you are not measuring so I'm tracking all my training sessions with my watch (in fact all my day except my sleep). This will allow me to study the metrics and prove wether following a proper plan has helped me or not. What I can say so far is that after completing the first scheduled week my cardio fitness state (that's how the watch calls to the estimation it mades of the VO2 max) has slightly increased. I know it is quite soon so this results are not legit yet, but they encourage me going on with it (mind games).

Another metric I also focus on is the HRV (Heart Rate Variability). Apparently the higher it is (inside the limits) the better heart feels and the better you are able to deal with stress situations. After reading about this parameter and its impact on human body I'm not pretty sure how to interpret it in the short term because stress situations, like training sessions for a HF are, could make HRV lower, but that doesn´t mean I am not ready for the challenge (I guess)...well let's see how it evolves. If you want to know about HRV I strongly recommend reading this Harvard Medical School [paper](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heart-rate-variability-new-way-track-well-2017112212789).

Besides the watch metrics I am tracking and recording my weight, and also my feelings. There are still a lot of training sessions ahead so I think the hardest part will be to strictly stick to the plan and run exactly the proposed distance at proposed pace and complete exactly all the strength exercises, so it will more like a mind endurance test rather than a physical one. I'm used to running those distances but the proposed pace is something makes me feel doubtful. One thing is running for fun the distance you want whenever you want an another thing is to do it even when you don't feel like to it and keeping a pace even faster than the one you need to hit the target on race day. But that's the challenge and therefore where fun is found.

Have a great week!

Javi

# Things I've enjoyed this week 🎉

- **Extreme E Championship -** First race of this electric racing buggies championship was held in Saudi Arabia desert. It is like the Dakar but with a closer battle between competitors. Only three cars take part at each race, and each race lasts only two laps. At the end of the first lap each car must head to the box for a driver switch. Several prestigious former Formula 1 and WRC drivers like Sebastian Loeb, Jenson Button or Carlos Sainz participate in it. Another feature is that this is a mixed gender championship, inside each time there is a male and a female driver. You can follow the action and even watch the races live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmlrp3y74JN1L1o1tSdeINw).
- Book: ***The Rosie Project*** by Graeme Simsion. I am not a big fan of fiction books but this one made me fall in love with literature again. The narrator, a professor with autism describes how he navigates his love relationships.
