Ey guys,

This week has been a little bit rare, nothing special to highlight to be honest. Just focusing on learning how to code in Xcode, reading as much as I can and being very hipped about recent and future space exploration missions. Definitely the aeronautics and space is a sector I really would like to work at. If you are new in this realm and you would like to know more about it, I strongly recommend you to take a look to this two NASA missions:

- Artemis Mission: it is expected that in 2021 a human being will be again on the surface of the Moon, including the first woman and the first person of color. This program is taking all the steps to achieve those goals. Last update is that company SpaceX has been selected for the development and manufacture of the HLS (Human Landing System), which will literately put the astronauts on the surface of the moon. That spacecraft is the SpaceX Starship, which is already being tested here at Earth.
- Mars Perseverance Rover: a couple of months ago this robotic vehicle landed on the surface of Mars. Its aim is to explore the environment of the red planet as another step in the path of sending a person there at some day. This vehicle also brings a drone to help him spot the best places to explore in advance of moving the rover. You can follow the action through NASA's YouTube channel with real images taken by the rover.

The space sector has grow up a lot during the last decade, passing from a 60K dollar billion business to a 200K one, but since it is not a day by day sector for many people we do not realise about it. SpaceX has "democratised" the access to the space for many governments and companies, making it much more affordable that it was few years ago when everyone who wanted to put something in this space only had the option of reaching out to one of the big companies that where operating in this sector, like Boing or Lockheed Martin. For instance, 15 years ago each human mission launch, I mean each little spacecraft that was brought to the orbit with a person inside cost around 200 dollar millions whereas SpaceX offers the same service for 60 dollar millions.

When I was a child I wanted to become an astronaut or a racing car engineer, but when Fernando Alonso showed up winning two Formula 1 championships I focused on the automotive sector. Now that I've fulfilled that little dream by working in the development of combustion and hybrid powertrains for several years, that little spark about the space is growing again inside me. Lets see how I manage to reach to that sector as a professional prospect during the next months.

Have a great week!!!

# Things I've enjoyed this week 🎉

- **The mosquito coast:** great serie broadcasted on Apple TV. This is a story about a family that is being chased by the FBI for something the father did in the past. Just two episodes released, lets see how it evolves but seems to be really promising. The story is based on the book written by Paul Theroux.
- Book: ***Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future*** by Ashlee Vance.
